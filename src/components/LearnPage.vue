            <summary><b>What are the risks associated with event contracts?</b></summary>
            <p>Event contracts are a complex product that involves certain risks.<br><br>
                <b>Risk:</b> Event contracts may have no value at expiration.  At the end of the contract, depending on the outcome of the event, you may lose all the funds used to enter that contract.</br>
                <b>Safeguard:</b> Contract fees are not charged on zero-payout contracts.  The maximum risk is the total amount of money the market participant pays for the contracts plus the commission levied on those contracts.  You should consider whether you can afford the high risk of losing this money.<br><br>
                <b>Risk:</b> Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. may not be able to pay out winning contracts.<br>
                <b>Safeguard:</b> We will refrain from excessive leverage and will hold significant cash assets to pay out contracts.<br><br>
                <b>Risk:</b> Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. and all other parties may simultaneously go bankrupt.<br>
                <b>Safeguard:</b> Funds from dissolution under bankruptcy will be used to pay out winning contracts.<br><br>
                <b>Risk:</b> Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. does not provide trading or tax advice.  Our service is "execution only" and we will not advise you on any transaction.  You should obtain financial and taxation advice as to whether event contracts are an appropriate investment for you.<br><br>
                <b>Risk:</b> You may not be able to exit an event contract due to a trading freeze.  Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. has the authority to freeze trading to protect market participants.  Unexpected trading freezes may affect your positions.<br><br>
                <b>Risk:</b> Event contract prices may not reflect the probability of an underlying event occurring or failing to occur.  You may suffer unexpected losses due to speculative or volatile market prices.<br><br>
                <b>Risk:</b> The expiration dates of event contracts may change.  Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. has the authority to update the expiration date of outstanding event contracts if the resolution of an event is delayed or accelerated unexpectedly.
