        <p>
        Please read these terms and conditions ("Terms") carefully, because they affect your legal rights. If you do not agree to these Terms, you cannot use our event contract services.<br><br>
        These Terms govern your use of the execution-only contract exchange and clearinghouse services ("Services") furnished to you by Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. ("we"). Your use of the Services is further subject to provisions in any other relevant disclaimers and terms presented to you on our Web site.<br><br>
        <b>Contracts:</b> The contracts listed at the contract exchange are event contracts. For each event question, a "Yes" Contract and a "No" Contract is listed.<br><br>
        <b>Settlement:</b> The settlement of an event contract is based on the outcome of its linked event question. Event questions can be based on any event the Exchange chooses.<br><br>
        <b>Orders:</b> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are permitted to use the Service to submit <b>non-binding offers to purchase contracts</b> ("Orders"). By doing so, you grant us a non-exclusive right to use, copy, store, and transmit the contents of your Orders and to solicit you regarding them, in each case, to the extent required to provide the Service.<br><br>
        <b>Order Execution Offers.</b> When we have the means to execute an Order submitted by a market participant, we will offer them a binding contract that reflects the terms of the event contract(s) relevant to the Order. Such an offer is called an Order Execution Offer, which the market participant may accept by paying the stipulated amount or decline by refusing to pay.<br><br>
        <b>Entering Positions.</b> Market participants enter into event contracts by accepting an Order Execution Offer submitted to them by us.<br><br>
        <b>Pricing.</b> The prices of a linked "Yes" Contract and "No" Contract is determined by inverse pricing. The Exchange may offer prices between 0.03 Tau and 0.99 Tau. When a market participant accepts an Order Execution Offer, the market participant executes a contract with us, subject to all of the terms laid out, and we will have the obligation to pay the required sum when the event contract settles.<br><br>
        <b>Non-Refundability.</b> Fees and purchases are final and non-refundable. Contracts may not be altered or cancelled once confirmed. We may, in our sole discretion, provide a refund to you in a specific instance.<br><br>
        <b>Arbitration.</b> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. to the extent permitted by all available laws and to litigate any disputes and breaches of contract through arbitration by a third-party.<br><br>
        <b>Changes to These Terms.</b> Miraculin–Daemon Markets Ltd. reserves the right to make modifications to these Terms at any time.<br><br>
        <b>Governing Law.</b> These Terms are governed by the laws of SimDemocracy. You agree to litigate such lawsuits and legal disputes as are permitted hereunder and under all relevant laws within the courts of SimDemocracy.
